A simple go program that uses the Seam-Carving algorithm to remove pixels from an image.

This program includes a simple edge detection algorithm using the Sobel operator.

This program is not good. The algorithms were implemented from scratch to help me understand how the algorithm works.
It could also help you, so feel free to learn from it.
